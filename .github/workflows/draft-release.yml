            Hi @${{ github.actor }}!
            This PR was created in response to a manual trigger of the release workflow here: https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }}.
            I've updated the changelog with commit messages and bumped the versions in the manifest files in this commit: ${{ steps.make-commit.outputs.commit }}.
            Merging this PR will create a GitHub Release and build and deploy assets on production machine.
